# Hi!
If you are looking for my repos they are all organized in organizations, you can find them all below!
## For my work done while in Lambda School you can check out:
#### [Unit One - Web Fundamentals](https://github.com/Lambda-Work-Unit-1) 
The goal of unit one is to learn to build user interfaces and introduce git. Concepts covered: Semantic HTML, display types, basic terminal use, basic git use, CSS specificity, and flex box.

*I am currently redoing/updating these projects over winter break

More units coming soon
