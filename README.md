# Hello person!
Welcome to my little place on GitHub! I have issues with the need to be organized. GitHub makes this harder then it should be; but, I have done my best to keep things neat and easy to work around.
## ðŸ˜”Lambda School
See this [list](https://github.com/ImCatherineNoel/ImCatherineNoel/blob/main/Lambda.md) of organizations containing projects done for the Lambda School 
### More to come!
I promise that more will be added. I have several projects that I am working on, when they are ready to shine they will live here too!
