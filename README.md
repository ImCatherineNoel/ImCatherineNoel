# Hello person!
Welcome to my little place on GitHub! I have issues with the need to be organized. GitHub makes this harder then it should be; but, I have done my best to keep things neat and easy to work around.

## ðŸ˜”Lambda School:
In 2020 I started learning web development at Lambda School.  I do **not** recommend you follow in my footsteps. Lambda was once a great program that changes and became more self study.

Because I would like to keep the dumpster fire that is Lambda as far away from my real life work You will ONLY find lambda work here.
