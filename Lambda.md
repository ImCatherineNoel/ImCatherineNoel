## ðŸ˜”Lambda School:
In 2020 I started learning web development at Lambda School.  I do **not** recommend you follow in my footsteps. This was a big mistake that I am regretting more and more every day.  
#### [Lambda Work - Course One : Web Fundamentals](https://github.com/Lambda-Work-Course-1)
The goal of unit one is to learn to build user interfaces and introduce git. Concepts covered: Semantic HTML, display types, basic terminal use, basic git use, CSS specificity, and flex box.
**I am currently redoing/updating these projects over winter break*
More units coming soon
