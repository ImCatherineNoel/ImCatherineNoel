## ðŸ˜”Lambda School:
In 2020 I started learning web development at Lambda School.  I do **not** recommend you follow in my footsteps. This was a big mistake that I am regretting more and more every day.  
#### [Lambda Work - Course One : Web Fundamentals](https://github.com/Lambda-Work-Course-1)
HTML, CSS, Git, JS Fundamentals including arrays and objects 

**I am currently redoing/updating projects*

#### [Lambda Work - Course Two: Web Applications I](https://github.com/Lambda-Work-Course-2)
Js, React, React Router, Form Managment, Testing with cypress.io

**My current unit, this work may be unpolished and in need of work as I am just starting to learn these concepts!**
